       "  'i was a little confused as i walked up to cotterell lighting store in the newington area. i was presented with what appeared to be a beautiful old church but the \\\\\"sale now on\\\\\" said something different. then, i noticed the huge signs for \\\\\"cotterell lighting\\\\\" and i decided to pop in. i was still really confused and wondered if i was entering some kind of bizarre lighting cult.\\\\n\\\\nas soon as i entered i realised that it was indeed a shop, and it sold lighting, all kinds of lighting, in every design you could think of. there were two friendly staff members working who just told me to give them a shout if i needed any help so i decided to browse. i couldn\\'t believe how many different lighting styles they had and if you\\'re looking for a new lampshade or light then you will find exactly what you\\'re looking for here. in addition to lighting they also do a small amount of furniture.\\\\n\\\\ni noticed a really cool mirror ball light, a lampshade on a stand that was designed to look like a fish bone and a huge mirror that i like instantly as it made me look better than i actually do.\\\\n\\\\ni have to admit, it was a little odd walking around an old church and it was pretty much intact apart from the missing pews. when i looked up i could see that the upper seating of the church was still there and if that area was still accessible you could have taken a seat and looked down at the now lighting shop. the creaking floor boards were still there as were the stained glass window and painted high ceiling. it seems a waste that such a beautiful church is now just a shop and even stranger that it hasn\\'t been disguised as a shop.\\\\n\\\\ni\\'d recommend visiting under the guise that you need a new lightbulb, as it really is an experience.',\n",
       "  \"i should have read the reviews before we ate there but i didn't.  i was not impressed with the lasagna at all.  the sauce was very bland and there was very little meat or ricotta cheese in it.  it was mostly noodle.  my husband had the lobster ravioli which as better than my lasagna but still not that great.  i used a restaurant.com certificate so that helped but i don't think it would be some place i will go back to when i am in vegas again.\",\n",

       "  'i was all set to write this place off as completely over-rated, but i have to admit, this buffet is pretty darn good. usually, the line for this buffet is ridiculous. my visit to vegas this time was mid-week, and i was fortunate enough to choose a good time to chow down, as the line was a scant 20 people deep.\\\\n\\\\npretty interior, lots of seating, interesting sections which gave you a feeling like there was inside seating and outside seating because of little \\'rooms\\' within the seating area. \\\\n\\\\nplenty of choices to satisfy most cravings. standard buffet fare and some non-standard selections as well. most people gravitate to the crab legs at buffets, i\\'m more of a prime rib kinda gal. the prime rib here was pretty good. i admit, i grabbed some of the mushroom sauce meant for the chateaubriand instead of the au jus. i think it was a good choice. \\\\n\\\\nother items i had were the brussel sprouts (don\\'t judge me), kielbasa and sauerkraut, chicken with a wine/mushroom sauce. all very, very good. desserts were plentiful. i tried a creme brulee and a puff thing that i have no idea what it was called but it was damn good.\\\\n\\\\ni\\'m not sure i liked this buffet enough to pay the single visit price and wait in the usually long line. i had purchased the \\\\\"buffet of buffets\\\\\" deal, so it was worth it in this case. \\\\n\\\\nthe food is very good, service was great. as soon as i went up for dessert, a staff member came by and offered me coffee. it\\'s like she read my mind. if you\\'re a multiple plate buffet champ, it\\'s probably worth the wait and the price. if you\\'re like me and a 1-plate wonder, maybe spend your $30 elsewhere.',\n",
